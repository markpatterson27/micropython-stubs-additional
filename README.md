# micropython-stubs-additional

MicroPython stubs to help with enriching development environments. Still very much a work-in-progress.

These stubs are intended to be used alongside https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs. [micropython-stubs](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubs) provides most of the stubs, while this repo fills in some docstring and parameter details.
